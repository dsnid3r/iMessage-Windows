# iMessage for Windows

In this repo you will find some of the original files from 2013 when a working iMessage for Windows client was built.

Originally built as a proof of concept it was ultimately released to the public in a statement against Apple's refusal to do so.

# Where is the rest of it?

As some might know the raw version of the .exe was never released. Apple almost immediately issued a cease and desist order and prevented us from releasing it. So we released what we could in hope it might help others for educational purposes.

# Why are you updating the readme 5 years later?

After noticing the readme was HTML from some old project I decided to update it. I hadn't touched this repo sense the incident took place, this is just to finally give this some context.
